# Sairen
Linux From Scratch Project

Sairen Linux is meant to have UI built on Python and Kivy. 
The UI is to give the user something nice to look at as well as add ease of use.
The average user should never have to touch the terminal. As this is not a dev build.
The idea is to build a fully working UI based on python and kivy. Sitting on top of a Linux Kernel.
All programs running on the OS that contain a UI must have an icon for that program so that it is clickable from the UI.
