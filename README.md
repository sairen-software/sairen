Sairen Linux is meant to have UI built on Python and Kivy.

The UI is to give the user something nice to look at as well as add ease of use.

The average user should never have to touch the terminal. As this is not a dev build.

The idea is to build a fully working UI based on python and kivy. Sitting on top of a Linux Kernel.

All programs running on the OS that contain a UI must have an icon for that program so that it is clickable from the UI.

It is recomended that since you have the ability to use any to use any compatable program with Sairen Linux. All programs be able to auto configure and install. As well as resolve any dependency issues without additional user input. Install software should be as painfree as possible.

So if something needs to be compiled it is to be done before download as a binary, bytecode, etc.. before install. All work of configuring must be done behind the senses and must install without hitch. Unless so packet is missing during download. Then we kinda expect it to fail.

This Linux Distro is to act as a consumer product. Nothing unfinished is to go inside of any repository for Sairen software unless it it ready for the avaerage user with littel to know input on its operation. Interation should feel instinctive and not a job to learn. Keep it simple(This does not apply to software that would normally require a certification to prove you know what your doing). Such as a compiler or any other developmental software a simple UI is not required. But it is expected like all other software. To install and run without fault.

There should be an optional console(CLI) app built into the UI as an app for all those who want to use the console. As well as have the option to go headless.
